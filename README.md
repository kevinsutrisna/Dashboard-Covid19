![Dashboard-Covid19](Dashboard.gif)
The project involves creating a COVID-19 dashboard using Looker that displays data from various countries, with daily updates facilitated by a Google Sheets script feeding data into BigQuery. Python will be employed to categorize countries based on their COVID-19 death rates, allowing for trend analysis and clustering of fatality rates. The primary aim is to offer an accessible tool for tracking the pandemic and conducting in-depth analyses of fatality rates.
